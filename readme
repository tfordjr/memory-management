Compile and run instructions:
simply run make command and oss command in the following format:
./oss -n 7 -s 8 -t 2 -i 100 -f logfile.txt
-n processes, -s simultaneous processes, -t max runtime, -i launch interval(ms), -f logfile
use the -h arg to learn more about how to use these commands.
Args default to appropriate figures if not provided, can be in any order.

Features: 
oss.cpp: processes args and handles child forking with fork_and_wait function.
user.cpp: user executable takes one arg for number of iterations. prints and sleeps. 
pcb.h: contains pcb struct and many related functions for process table utility.
clock.h: logical clock struct.
makefile: creates oss and user executables, oss executes user executable to perform work.
readme: explains project

Concerns: 


Known Problems or Bugs: 
    clock.h:13 - incrementing clock by 250 ns works perfectly, but incrementing by
        250ms/numProcesses leads to processes remaining on the process table for too long.
