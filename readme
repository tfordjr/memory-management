Compile and run instructions:
simply run make command and oss command in the following format:
oss -n 4 -s 2 -t 3
where -n is total processes, -s simultaneous processes, and -t iterations done
use the -h arg to learn more about how to use these commands.
Args default to 1 if not provided.

Features: 
oss.cpp: processes args and handles child forking with fork_and_wait funciton.
         args work regardless of order
user.cpp: user executable takes one arg for number of iterations. prints and sleeps. 
makefile: creates oss and user executables, oss executes user executable to perform work.

Problem areas: 
not detatching and deleting shared memory on signal catching
    should I also setup signal catching in user.cpp and dt from shm there too?

I followed the guidance to have the user (child) processes print a message everytime they
notice a change on the clock, but for my program, the clock increments every 200 ns, so
I've commented that line(line 52 user.cpp) out as it spams stdout. I did include that req.
